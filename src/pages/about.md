## Who are you?
My name is Funmi, and I'm an engineering leader based in Brooklyn, New York. I started my career as a software engineer on Wall Street and have so far lived in Lagos, Washington DC, New York, London, and San Francisco. I get excited about lots of different things including books, sequins, mindfulness, travel, being outdoors, building community, unreasonably committed app streaks, and limited edition Nespresso coffee pods. I recently decided to take a sabbatical from work to explore some other creative interests. I'm looking forward to writing about all of that here!

## Sure... but what's your _full_ name?
Okay, you caught me. My full name is actually [Olúfúnmiláyọ̀](https://www.ancestry.com/first-name-meaning/olufunmilayo), but nobody calls me that --- Funmi works great!

## What a beautiful name! Where is it from? And how do you pronounce it?
Thanks, I hear that all the time! (No, really). It's from the [Yorùbá ethnic group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoruba_people) in West Africa, primarily Nigeria. The easiest way for a non-native to pronounce it is "O-lou-foo-me-lah-yuh" --- think of the "n" as sort of silent. If you're curious about the correct pronunciation of 'Funmi', [give this a listen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Funmi.ogg).

## What's an ambitious goal you've set that initially seemed impossible?
In December 2016, I signed up for my first triathlon on impulse, as a forcing function to finally learn how to swim and ride a bike, two things I'd been putting off for a very long time. That race was the [August 2017 Chicago SuperSprint Triathlon](https://by.supertri.com/chicago-triathlon/supersprint/). That meant I had less than 8 months to not only learn how to swim the required 400-yard distance but also become capable of doing it in open water. Crazy? I didn't think so at the time! It was a daunting goal, but I managed to accomplish it and even completed the race far from dead last. I clearly had a blast or something like that because the following year, I went on to complete a half ironman triathlon (1.2-mile swim, 56-mile bike ride, and 13.1-mile run) in Cozumel, Mexico. So that's the story of how I got into triathlons!

## If you could instantly master any programming language you don't already know, which would you choose and why?
I've just started learning to program in Rust, so that'd probably be my choice. I'm coming from a lifetime (heh) of thinking in Java, so adjusting to Rust's many idiosyncrasies has been both interesting and challenging.

## What's one Nigerian tradition you've maintained in your NYC life?
This probably doesn't count as "tradition" per se, but my favorite Nigerian dish is [jollof rice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jollof_rice), and I probably eat it at least once a month.
