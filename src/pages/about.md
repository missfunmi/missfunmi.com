## Who are you?
My name is Funmi, and I'm a software engineering leader currently based in Brooklyn, New York City. I started my career as a software engineer on Wall Street and have so far lived in Lagos, Washington DC, New York, London, and San Francisco. I recently decided to take a sabbatical from work to explore some other interests. I'm looking forward to writing about them here!

## Sure... but what's your _full_ name?
Okay, you caught me. My full name is [Olufunmilayo](https://www.ancestry.com/first-name-meaning/olufunmilayo). But nobody calls me that --- Funmi works great!

## What a beautiful name! Where is it from? And how do you pronounce it?
Thanks, I hear that all the time! (No, really). It's a Yoruba name, [one of the largest ethnic groups in Nigeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoruba_people). The easiest way for a non-native to pronounce it is "O-lou-foo-me-lah-yuh" --- think of the "n" as sort of silent. If you're curious about the correct pronunciation of Funmi, [give this a listen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Funmi.ogg).

## What's an ambitious goal you've set that initially seemed impossible?
In December 2016, I signed up for my first triathlon on impulse, as a forcing function to finally learn how to swim and ride a bike, two things I'd been putting off for a very long time. That race was the [2017 Chicago SuperSprint Triathlon](https://by.supertri.com/chicago-triathlon/supersprint/), then run by Lifetime. At the time, I didn't know a single other triathlete, so I convinced one of my best friends to sign up with me. We raced in a category that seems to have since been discontinued: the [Divvy Wave](https://www.instagram.com/divvybikes/p/ChkQuOHLJqa/), where participants would perform the bike leg on one of the city's bikeshares. Crazy? I didn't think so at the time! I clearly had a blast or something like that because the following year, I went on to complete a half ironman triathlon (1.2 mile swim, 56 mile bike ride, and 13.1 mile run) in Cozumel, Mexico. So that's the story of how I got into triathlons!

## If you could instantly master any programming language you don't already know, which would you choose and why?
Well, currently I'm working very hard (fighting, really) to learn Rust, so it'd probably be that one, so I can get past all the (currently confusing) bits around lifetimes and ownership and whatnot.

## What's one Nigerian tradition you've maintained in your NYC life?
This probably doesn't count as "tradition" per se, but my favorite Nigerian dish is [jollof rice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jollof_rice), and I probably eat it at least once a month.
